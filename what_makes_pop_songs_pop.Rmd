## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r load, echo=FALSE}

# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Load the data set
data <- read.csv("Spotify_Song_Attributes.csv")

# Convert duration from milliseconds to minutes and seconds
data$duration_min <- data$duration_ms / 60000

# Filter for pop genres
pop_data <- data %>% filter(grepl("pop", genre, ignore.case = TRUE))

# Remove duplicates
pop_data <- pop_data %>% distinct(trackName, .keep_all = TRUE)

```

## Danceability vs Energy

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

# Calculate average danceability and energy by genre
genre_summary <- pop_data %>%
  group_by(genre) %>%
  summarise(avg_danceability = mean(danceability),
            avg_energy = mean(energy)) %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_energy))

# Plot
ggplot(genre_summary, aes(x = reorder(genre, -avg_energy), y = avg_energy)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Danceability and Energy by Pop Genre",
       x = "Genre",
       y = "Average Energy") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

```

### Speechiness vs Energy

```{r}
# Scatter plot of speechiness vs energy
ggplot(pop_data, aes(x = speechiness, y = energy)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Speechiness vs. Energy in Pop Songs",
       x = "Speechiness",
       y = "Energy")

```
